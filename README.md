# Interactive Data Visualization with Plotly Express

## Overview

This project demonstrates interactive data visualization techniques using Plotly Express, a Python library for creating interactive plots and dashboards. It includes various tasks and mini-challenges focusing on plotting interactive box plots, histograms, density maps, scatter matrices, violin plots, and 2D histogram contour plots. The dataset used in this project includes cancer data and university admission data.

## Features
